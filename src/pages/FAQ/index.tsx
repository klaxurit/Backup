      "People use staking for all the things that can provide a return on an asset from a determinate source. In fact, we use staking when it comes to interact with a Smart Contract, and loosing the ownership of the asset.",

      "We call it delegating as you are still have the ownership of the asset but only giving the power of Vote from your asset to the validator you are delegating to.",
