            <h4 className="Product__content__FAQ__article__title">What is an asset?</h4>
            <p>An asset is something defined as valuable or useful, as cash, house, cryptocurrency...</p>
            <p>At StakeLab, we support a large list of cryptocurrencies that can be delegated to our validators and provide tools to leverage the benefits from them. You can access to asset management, dashboards, and DCA.</p>

            <h4 className="Product__content__FAQ__article__title">Whatâ€™s the difference between Staking and Delegating?</h4>
            <p>People use staking for all the things that can provide a return on an asset from a determinate source. In fact, we use staking when it comes to interact with a Smart Contract, and loosing the ownership of the asset.</p>
            <p>In PoS (Proof of Stake) blockchains and using a validator, you are not interacting with a Smart Contract but at the protocol level.</p>
            <p>We call it delegating as you are still have the ownership of the asset but only giving the power of Vote from your asset to the validator you are delegating to.</p>
            <p>Then you can ask us why StakeLab instead of DelegateLab... well, you just read it and realise why we guess!</p>
